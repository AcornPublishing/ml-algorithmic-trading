# Chapter 06: Machine Learning

## Learning from Data

## The Machine Learning Workflow

### Basic Walkthrough: K-nearest neighbors

- sklearn [Documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)

#### Code Examples: Workflow

The directory k-nearest neighbors contains the `machine_learning_workflow.ipynb` notebook with several examples that illustrate the machine learning workflow using a simple dataset of house prices.

### Frame the problem: goals & metrics

### Collect & prepare the data

### How to explore, extract and engineer features

#### Code Example: Mutual Information

The notebook mutual_information.ipynb applies information theory to the financial data we created in Chapter 4, Alpha Factors â€“ Research and Evaluation.

### Select an ML algorithm

### Design and tune the model

#### Code Example: Bias-Variance Trade-Off


### How to use cross-validation for model selection

#### Code Example

- Yellowbrick: Machine Learning Visualization[docs](http://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/)
